## Project Motivation
In today's landscape, individuals frequently procure daily essentials from nearby supermarkets, resulting in a plethora of choices. However, a significant challenge faced by retailers is the optimal arrangement of items. Often, they lack insights into customer purchasing habits, leading to uncertainty about the placement of products within their stores.

My project is driven by the primary goal of uncovering answers to the following inquiries:
Question 1: What are the top 10 items?
Question 2: What are the number of items sold by the day, month and hour?
Question 3: How many transaction in weekdays compare to weekends
